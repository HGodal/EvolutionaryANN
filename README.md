## Anaconda Environment
To organise the libraries utilised in our project. A anaconda environment is stored in the folder "Environment". 

For a deeper explanation of managing environments. see the documentation [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).

### Setting up environment from file

Open anaconda command line and type 

> conda env create -f DAT540EANN.yml

Anaconda will then set up a environment with the packages specifiedin the .yml file

### Exporting environment | Updating environment

If you as a contributor have installed a new library, the code in this repoisotory is dependent on that library. To update the anaconda environment, type

> conda env export > DAT540EANN.yml

OR

Update the environment.yml file manually and use the command

> conda env update --prefix ./env --file environment.yml  --prune

The --prune option causes conda to remove any dependencies that are no longer required from the environment.
